## Motivation
I first started cubing back in middle school and immediatly fell in love. As time went on, I always wanted to design my own cube, but I never had the skills, knowledge, or means to do so. Fast forward to my internship at 3D Systems. As a part of my training, I was given license to own a build from start to finish so that I could experience their entire manufacturing process. By this point in my life, I had developed both the skills and knowledge to create a cube of my own and I had now been provided with the means to make something truely unique and special. What better an opportunity than this? <!-- fix this sentence? --> 

## Process
### Planning
Since I wanted my cube to be functional, I decided to base all of my dimensions on an old cube in my collection. The primary benefit of this being I could fit my pieces to a pre-existing core that required no maintenance. Typically, speedcubes require lubrication with use, but because I didn't anticipate solving my titanium cube that often, this wouldn't be a concern. This way, I could have the reliability and functionality of a normal cube, but still make a majority of it my own.

### Modeling and Design Choices
<!-- talk about modeling the pieces -->
On a Rubik's cube there are a total of 32 pieces that are broken down into three piece groups: corners, edges, and centers. The center pieces are made of two sub-pieces: the body and the cap; this is so you can adjust the tension provided by the springs in each center, thereby changing what the cube feels like as it turns. Since there are no differences other than that, I only had to model four different types of pieces instead of 32.<!-- i dont really like how that sounds but whatever for now--> I took calipers and measured each type of piece, making sure to pay particular attention to the internal parts that mesh and flow over eachother. Next, I was able to translate my measurements into SolidWorks and model the four pieces. This allowed me to assemble them together and check for interference.

<!-- talk about my reasons for each piece also can make a joke about actually having to model 26 pieces, which is better than 32 but not as great as 4 -->
Now that I had my model, I needed to design each face to make them unique. I felt that the traditional route of stickers wasted a chance to showcase the titanium and the capabilities of DMP; I also wanted to take the time to commemorate my summer experience. This led me to choosing six events of note: <!-- bleh what fix this --> the 3D Systems logo, Colorado flag variant, rock climber, hiker, Colorado Avalanche, and a lattice structure. The lattice structure is a particular favorite because one of my internship projects involved manipulating lattices on implants for a medical device manufacturer. I was able to project PNGs of the logos and my drawings onto each face and cut into the pieces to establish each design. The lattice, however, could be generated directly within each face from 3DXpert.
<!-- mention the usage of magics?? -->
I wanted to take the opportunity to design some thing personal about my time in Denver so I decided to pick some thing notable of the summer such as working at 3D, The Denver flag rock climbing, hiking the avalanche hockey team and finally a lattice structure which is something that I had worked on during one of my projects medical devices. To represent the sides of the Rubiks cube after picking out what I wanted each of the faces to be I modeled a Rubiks cube that when assembled on a core that I had lying around would enable it to be functional. So I designed every piece all of the  32 pieces necessary to make it functional. After I was done cutting them up I took it into 3-D expert their software to manipulate the pieces so that they would be able to be printed in titanium using direct metal laser sintering at the end of the project I was able to post process the pieces send them down and file them down so that it was actually able to be functional. At the end of it all the final cube ended up weighing INSERT  Weight HERE compared to a normal X GRAMS and I was able to do one practice of which took me just under an hour (when i can normally do it in under 30 seconds (I havent been practicing much recently)) because it was so heavy and difficult to turn. Everyone I had worked with loved the idea and it was a very great project that happily sits on my desk to this day

### Printing
<!-- can talk about 3dxpert build prep, how long it took, maybe include video of print, final build plate?, post processing -->
