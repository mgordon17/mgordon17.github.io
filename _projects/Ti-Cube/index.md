## Motivation
I first started cubing back in middle school and immediatly fell in love. As time went on, I always wanted to design my own cube, but I never had the skills, knowledge, or means to do so. Fast forward to my internship at 3D Systems. As a part of my training, I was given license to own a build from start to finish so that I could experience their entire manufacturing process. By this point in my life, I had developed both the skills and knowledge to do create a cube of my own and I had now been provided with the means to make something truely unique and special. What better an opportunity than this? <!-- fix this sentence? --> 

## Process
### Planning
wanted to fit an existing core that i had

### Modeling
<!-- talk about modeling the pieces -->
measured each different piece
modeled in cad

### Design Choices
<!-- talk about my reasons for each piece -->
Now that I had my model, I needed to design each face to make them unique. I felt that stickers wasted an chance to showcase the titanium and the capabilities of DMP; I also wanted to commemorate my summer. 

so I decided to combine one of my passions with your Rubiks cubes with this opportunity.  first I had to decide what I wanted each face to be since the traditional method of stickers wouldn't work as well and I wanted to take the opportunity to design some thing personal about my time in Denver so I decided to pick some thing notable of the summer such as working at 3-D, The Denver flag rock climbing hiking the avalanche hockey team and finally a lattice structure which is something that I had worked on during one of my projects. To represent the sides of the Rubiks cube after picking out what I wanted each of the faces to be I modeled a Rubiks cube that when assembled on a core that I had lying around would enable it to be functional. So I designed every piece all of the  32 pieces necessary to make it functional. After I was done cutting them up I took it into 3-D expert their software to manipulate the pieces so that they would be able to be printed in titanium using direct metal laser sintering at the end of the project I was able to post process the pieces send them down and file them down so that it was actually able to be functional. At the end of it all the final cube ended up weighing INSERT  Weight HERE and I was able to do one practice of which took me just under an hour (when i can normally do it in under 30 seconds (I havent been practicing much recently)) because it was so heavy and difficult to turn. Everyone I had worked with loved the idea and it was a very great project that happily sits on my desk to this day
