## Motivation
For my senior design project, my group and I worked with Ilana, a congenital amputee, to design an upgraded prosthetic for her left arm. <!-- Her previous arm, while aesthetically pleasing, had next to no functionality and caused extensive strain on her neck and shoulder due to the weight. --> When introduced to us, she was using a stationary arm that did not have mobility in the fingers, leaving her incapable of grasping, holding, or any other mobile task. Being the mother of two young children, as well as an elementary school teacher, Ilana would therefore find it helpful both at home and at her job to have a prosthetic arm with basic gripping functionality where pushing a stroller or changing diapers might be made easier. In the past, Ilana has used robotic arms, but has found them uncomfortably heavy, weighing between 4-5 lbs. She also finds them to be not aesthetically pleasing. Ilana and her occupational therapist, Christine, have posited the idea of using a ratcheting finger mechanism to open and close the prosthetic hand to create gripping motions. Ilana would utilize her right hand in order to control this mechanism. The goal of this project is to create a prosthetic arm with basic gripping capabilities that is both lightweight and aesthetically pleasing.

## Process
design iteration process - talk about the deisgn matrices or decisoin matrix whatever it was called

### Protypes

quick and dirty prototype - made out of card board, string, tape, hot glue. rough materials. proof of concept
then we designed the wooden prototype for the fingers to test the friction idea
first 3d printed protoype before i thought to scan the existing one
scan of arm

### Testing

three different performance goals
1. Pick up an empty water bottle from a surface, unscrew the lid, fill the bottle up while holding it in one hand, then hold it while screwing the lid back on. 
2. Pick up an empty water bottle from a surface, unscrew the lid, fill the bottle up while holding it in one hand, then hold it while screwing the lid back on. 
3. Pick up an empty water bottle from a surface, unscrew the lid, fill the bottle up while holding it in one hand, then hold it while screwing the lid back on. 

## End Result

final arm with its friction fingers, bendy thumb, quick release insert that matches her currect attechment system
