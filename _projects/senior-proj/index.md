## Motivation
For my senior design project, my group and I worked with Ilana, a congenital amputee, to design an upgraded prosthetic for her left arm. <!-- Her previous arm, while aesthetically pleasing, had next to no functionality and caused extensive strain on her neck and shoulder due to the weight. --> She introduced herself to us using a stationary arm that did not have mobility in the fingers, leaving her incapable of grasping, holding, or any other mobile task. Being the mother of two young children, as well as an elementary school teacher, Ilana would therefore find it helpful both at home and at her job to have a prosthetic arm with basic gripping functionality where pushing a stroller or changing diapers might be made easier. In the past, Ilana has used robotic arms, but has found them uncomfortably heavy, weighing between 4-5 lbs. She also finds them to be not aesthetically pleasing. Ilana and her occupational therapist, Christine, have posited the idea of using a ratcheting finger mechanism to open and close the prosthetic hand to create gripping motions. Ilana would utilize her right hand in order to control this mechanism. The goal of this project is to create a prosthetic arm with basic gripping capabilities that is both lightweight and aesthetically pleasing.
